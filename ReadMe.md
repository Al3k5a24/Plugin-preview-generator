# Digital Asset & Software Marketplaces - Automated Preview Generator

## 📌 Problem

Customers cannot evaluate a software plugin or template without buying and installing it, leading to:
- purchase hesitation,
- reduced conversions,
- increased refund rates.

## 🎯 Solution

This system **automatically generates safe, visual previews** of plugins/templates provided by sellers, letting customers see **exactly how the asset behaves in practice** before purchase.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1️⃣ **Seller Uploads Code**  
The seller provides their code (e.g., JavaScript plugin, template).

2️⃣ **Sandboxed Execution**  
The system runs the provided code inside an **isolated Docker container** to ensure security.

3️⃣ **Automated Preview Generation**  
Using **Playwright/Selenium**, the system:
- spins up a test environment,
- loads the seller's plugin into a sample application,
- interacts with it automatically,
- captures **screenshots and/or short GIFs** demonstrating its functionality.

4️⃣ **Vision-Enabled LLM Summary**  
A vision-enabled LLM analyzes the generated previews and automatically writes a **short summary** describing what the plugin does.

5️⃣ **Preview Delivery**  
The generated screenshots/GIFs and summary are provided to the marketplace, enabling customers to preview assets safely before purchasing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **n8n** – orchestrates the automation pipeline.
- **Docker** – sandboxes untrusted seller code safely.
- **Playwright / Selenium** – automates browser interactions and captures visual previews.
- **Vision-enabled LLM** – generates natural language summaries from captured previews.

## 🚀 Use Cases

✅ **Plugin Marketplaces** (WordPress, Shopify, Figma)  
✅ **Template Stores** (React/Vue templates, UI kits)  
✅ **Educational Assets** (interactive JS/CSS/HTML snippets)  
✅ **Mobile/PC Mod Stores** (controlled environment demos)

---

## 🔒 Security

- Each seller upload is executed inside **isolated Docker containers** to prevent system compromise.
- Timeouts and resource limits are enforced to avoid abuse.

---

## 📈 Benefits

✅ Increases **customer trust** before purchase.  
✅ Reduces **refund rates**.  
✅ Automates seller preview generation, reducing manual workload.  
✅ Enables marketplaces to scale without reviewer bottlenecks.

## 🚧 Status

🛠️ **In development.**

Current focus:
- Reliable Docker sandbox execution for plugin demos.
- Stable automated preview capture pipeline.
- Integration with n8n for end-to-end orchestration.
- LLM-based auto-summary generation.
